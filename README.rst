Introduction
------------

cleese is a library for python applications that executes 
a shell command in an easy and straightforward manner.

What does it run?
-----------------

cleese will run any command you want, and also provide 
you with feedback in regular intervals on what the command is currently doing
(in the form of exit code and stdout and stderr).

cleese will not allow you to enter stuff in the stdin stream 
(at least not directly), since this is out of the scope of 
the project (at least for now).

Why cleese?
--------------

John Cleese is one of the many talented actors in the Monty Python group. You can learn more about him and other films here (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000092/).

The reason we wanted to pay our tribute to him, is that he plays the guy trying to dump a body to the dead collector in the "Not Dead Yet" sketch, so he ends up executing the guy (who's not actually dead).

How to Build
------------

For now 'make all' would be your best friend. We have plans of changing that. When we do, we'll update it here.
